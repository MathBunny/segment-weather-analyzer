# Strava Segment Wind Analysis (Deprecated)
## Purpose
The purpose of this web app is to analyze segment efforts on Strava and determine if wind was a considerable factor in the performance.

The new and improved website can be found at [here](http://stravawindanalysis.com). The new version allows users to login using Strava, use a newer correlation algorithm and with an improved user interface as well.

## Features
* Easy to use interface
* Appealing design with material design
* Quick operation with simple compute option and minimal user intervention
* Includes Google maps to visually see and confirm segment location
* Allows to compare data easily with automatically generated correlation calculation
